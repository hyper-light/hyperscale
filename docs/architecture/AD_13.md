# AD-13: Gate Split-Brain Prevention

**Decision**: Gates use the same split-brain prevention as managers.

**Rationale**:
- Gates coordinate across datacenters - split-brain would cause duplicate jobs
- Same SWIM-based detection works for gate clusters
- Consistent patterns reduce complexity

**Implementation**:
- `_gate_udp_to_tcp` maps UDP addresses to TCP for peer tracking
- `_active_gate_peers` tracks currently reachable peers
- `_on_node_dead` / `_on_node_join` handle peer failure/recovery
- Leadership re-election via `LocalLeaderElection` (same as managers)
- Pre-voting and term-based resolution prevent split-brain
