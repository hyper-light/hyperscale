# AD-11: State Sync Retries with Exponential Backoff

**Decision**: State sync operations use retries with exponential backoff.

**Rationale**:
- Network partitions are often transient
- Single-attempt sync may miss temporarily unavailable workers
- Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd on recovery

**Implementation**:
- `_request_worker_state(max_retries=3, base_delay=0.5)` retries with backoff
- `_request_manager_peer_state(max_retries=3, base_delay=0.5)` similarly
- Delay formula: `base_delay * (2 ** attempt)`
- After exhausting retries, error is logged but sync continues with other peers
