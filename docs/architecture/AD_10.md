# AD-10: Fencing Tokens from Terms

**Decision**: Fencing tokens are derived from election terms.

**Rationale**:
- Monotonically increasing
- Tied to leadership changes
- Workers can reject stale leader operations

**Implementation**:
- `get_fencing_token()` returns current term
- `is_fencing_token_valid(token)` checks `token >= current_term`
- Included in `WorkflowDispatch`, checked by workers
