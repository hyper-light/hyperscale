# AD-12: Manager Peer State Sync on Leadership

**Decision**: New leaders sync from both workers AND peer managers.

**Rationale**:
- Workers are source of truth for workflow execution state
- Peer managers have job-level metadata (retry counts, completion status)
- Both are needed for complete state recovery

**Implementation**:
- `_on_manager_become_leader()` calls both sync methods
- `_sync_state_from_workers()` - gets workflow execution state
- `_sync_state_from_manager_peers()` - gets job metadata
- Both use retry logic (AD-11)
